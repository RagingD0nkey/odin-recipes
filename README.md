# odin-recipes

In this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) I will create a simple website showing a couple of recipes. 

## Goal
My main objective is to implement a simple design, allowing the user to go from one recipe to the other via a main index page.
However, I will present the website as a restaurant menu, linking all menu items to their own recipe. Even the cocktail !

Recipes will be linked to their original [page](https://www.allrecipes.com/) every time.

## Difficulties
1. Trying to create a navigation menu at the bottom of the page. Had to use non breaking space to mimic tab space `nbsp;`

## Improvement
1. I would have liked to add a per/person ingredient list. If 2 peoples, halving ingredient, if 8, doubling it.
