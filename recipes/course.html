        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly oil a loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and saut√© yellow onions with a pinch of salt until they start to turn golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cloves crushed garlic and 2 teaspoons ginger, and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add cooled onion mixture to ground beef along with rice, egg, green onions, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, and black pepper. Use a fork, spatula, or your hands to mix together until evenly combined. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, press in firmly, and smooth the top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C), about 1 hour. Meatloaf can be served hot, or let cool, wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>For the sauce, combine 2 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon ginger, and 4 minced garlic cloves in a cold nonstick skillet.</li>
                <li>Turn heat on to medium-high. Once ginger and garlic start to sizzle, cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, then whisk in brown sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, ketchup, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.</li>
                <li>Whisk 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water together in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir into the sauce. Raise heat to medium-high and return to a simmer. Cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until needed (Sauce may be made ahead and reheated on medium-low heat).</li>
                <li>Remove cold meatloaf from the refrigerator and slice into 8 portions. Dust each side with cornstarch, and reheat over medium high heat in a nonstick skillet in a little bit of vegetable oil until browned and heated through. If surface browns before meatloaf is heated through, reduce heat to medium, and cover until done.</li>
                <li>Serve topped with the sauce; garnish with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
